	\section{Objective}
	The goal is to create a simulation of how an infection spreads. People will spawn in the simulation, move around, and have a chance of infecting themselves within a certain radius of infected people. Individuals will have different statuses, such as healthy, infected, isolated, etc. A user interface (UI) is required to display the simulation running.
	
	\section{Project Background}
	The project focuses on simulating the spread of an infection, incorporating different statuses for individuals, and providing a visual representation through a user interface.
	
	\section{Requirements}
	
	\subsection{Functionalities}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Simulation of people spawning and moving
		\item Infection spread within a specified radius
		\item Different statuses for individuals (healthy, infected, isolated, etc.)
		\item User interface for real-time simulation display
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Performance Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Efficient simulation processing
		\item Real-time or near-real-time representation of infection spread
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Security Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ensure data integrity within the simulation
		\item Secure communication within the simulation
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{User-Friendly Interface}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Intuitive UI for simulation display
		\item Clear documentation for user guidance
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Compatibility}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Compatibility with different platforms for UI
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Maintenance}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Easily maintainable for future updates
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Legal Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Compliance with licensing standards for software used in the project
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Use Cases}
	A user wants a simulation system that approximately represents the spread of infection with different individual statuses.
	
	\section{Interfaces}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item User interface for simulation display
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Data Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Simulation data, including individual statuses and movements
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Quality Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Accurate representation of infection spread
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Timeline and Milestones}
	The project must be completed by 23.03.24.
	
	\section{Budget and Resources}
	The budget for the project is to be determined. Necessary resources, including hardware, will be procured accordingly.
	
	\section{Risks and Assumptions}
	Potential risks include challenges in simulation accuracy. Assumptions include stable system performance.
	
	\section{Approval}
